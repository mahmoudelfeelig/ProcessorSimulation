# 🧠 ProcessorSimulation

A complete simulation of a custom-designed processor, built from scratch to emulate instruction execution, data flow, memory handling, and control logic. This project showcases a full educational pipeline, including assembler, datapath simulation, and test programs—ideal for learning computer architecture fundamentals.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Custom instruction set architecture (ISA)
- ✅ Simulated memory and register file
- ✅ ALU and control unit logic
- ✅ Support for various instruction types: arithmetic, memory, control
- ✅ Test programs to validate execution
- ✅ Modular and readable C++ code

---

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

This processor follows a typical 5-stage pipeline architecture:

1. **Fetch** – Retrieve instructions from memory  
2. **Decode** – Interpret opcode, resolve operands  
3. **Execute** – Perform ALU operations  
4. **Memory** – Read/write from simulated memory  
5. **Writeback** – Store results in registers  

Registers, memory, and control logic are all modeled in code, making it easy to extend or tweak.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- C++11 or higher
- A C++ compiler (e.g. `g++` or `clang++`)
- Make (optional, for build automation)

## 🧪 How to Run

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mahmoudelfeelig/ProcessorSimulation.git
   cd ProcessorSimulation
   ```

2. **Build the project:**

   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++11 -o processor main.cpp
   ```

   Or use the provided `Makefile` if available:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. **Run the simulation:**

   ```bash
   ./processor
   ```

   You can edit or replace the instruction input in the source to test different scenarios.
